# AP-VRG-PVR-RefugiaAR
This project analyses the role of artificial reefs acting as conservation habitats for climate-threated species, most notably sea star and sea urchins, along the Southern California Bight. This project employs multiple analytical approaches and all data processing and statistical testing were conducted in R. 

Analyses: 
- Population Metrics: Generated box plots to visualise density of focal species across distinct eras (pre-, during-, and post-wasting events). 
- Spatio-temporal Analysis: Utilised Progressive-Change BACIPs (Before-After-Control-Impact Paired Series) models to assess the effects of human intervention on the surrounding ecosystems.
- Geographical Visualisation: Mapped survey locations across the Southern California Bight using site coordinates to provide visual context during data presentation.
